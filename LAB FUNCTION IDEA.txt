LAB FUNCTION IDEA

DE-ALIASER:  
Words have different levels of abstraction:  "Tree" vs. "Acculturative Stress"
Tree is a noun, object, physical
AS is a noun, concept, ethereal

FUNCTION GOAL:  Remove the call for abstract information about the second items from memory by using NLP.  
STEP 1:  NLP scans the body of text and flags words at a certain level of abstraction
STEP 2:  Provides "comments" or hover-available information on the abstract terms so I don't have to call incomplete memories.
